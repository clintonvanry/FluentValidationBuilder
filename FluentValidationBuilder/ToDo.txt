design the retrieval of the preset

-- model for the active message -- partially done
-- mapper to build the active message

tests for the mapper

logic to build the correlationid


-- logic for correlationid
-- if one is supplied use it else generate with <guid>_formatid

-- no handling for duplicate message for transcode. A risk here especially if we are generating correlationid
-- perhaps the correlationid that we generates is a little smarter.
-- for transcode it is about the sourcefile and preset
-- but we can multiple presets in hte body
-- can we query this out and flatten to check for it
